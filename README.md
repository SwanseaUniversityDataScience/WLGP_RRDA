## üìù Project description

This repository contains scripts and resources developed for creating a **Research-Ready Data Asset (RRDA)** version of the **Welsh Longitudinal General Practice (WLGP)** data within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank.

The RRDA:
- Standardises curation of WLGP data to improve reproducibility and analytic readiness.
- Supports efficient large-scale queries by transforming event-list data into a structured, normalised format.
- Includes a comprehensive clinical code look-up to improve the mapping of events to known descriptions, allowing for more complete inclusion of recorded activity in analyses, especially in recent years when local and newer terminologies became more prevalent following the discontinuation of Read codes.
- Includes a four-layer classification framework to capture healthcare provider, access mode, interaction type, event details,  enabling patient‚Äìpractice interaction analysis.

Using this RRDA, we:
- Assessed population coverage (1990‚Äì2024), defined as the proportion of residents with shared primary care records, and stratified by demographic and geographic factors.
- Categorised GP events into key activity types (consultations, prescriptions, vaccinations, patient monitoring, etc.).
- Analysed longitudinal trends in GP activity before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
